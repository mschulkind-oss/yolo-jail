# Print one version's section of CHANGELOG.md, and refuse the ways a section can
# exist without saying anything.
#
# Adopted from Vantage (mschulkind-oss/vantage, scripts/changelog-section.sh),
# which is the reference implementation of the portfolio's changelog standard:
# the open-source-project skill's "Changelog and release notes" section and its
# references/changelog.md. Keep the two copies' rules the same; a refusal added
# to one belongs in the other.
#
# TWO CALLERS, ONE DEFINITION OF "the prose exists". `just release` runs this
# before it creates a tag, so a version whose notes were never written cannot
# become one. The `goreleaser` job in .github/workflows/release.yml runs it
# against the tag's own tree and hands what it prints to goreleaser as
# `--release-notes`, which makes it the GitHub release body. publish.yml runs it
# too, as the gate in front of PyPI and the image pushes. Until 2026-09-25 the
# body was goreleaser's commit-subject list, and the only prose about an upgrade
# lived in a separate upgrade-notes doc that no release carried (folded into
# CHANGELOG.md and deleted the same day).
#
# Usage:
#   changelog-section.sh [--link-base <url>] [--unwrap] <version> [changelog-file]
#
# <version> may be written `0.11.0` or `v0.11.0`; the file defaults to
# CHANGELOG.md beside this script's repository root, so the caller's working
# directory does not matter.
#
# Exit 0 with the section on stdout; 1 with the reason on stderr when there is no
# usable prose; 2 on a usage error or an unreadable file. Diagnostics go to
# STDERR, not stdout, because stdout is the payload: `just release` redirects it
# to /dev/null and must still show the reader why it refused.
#
# WHAT IT PRINTS is the section body — everything under the version heading up to
# the next version heading, minus the heading itself and the blank lines around
# the body, and nothing else changed unless `--link-base` or `--unwrap` asks
# (below). Nothing is re-wrapped, so hard line breaks
# (two trailing spaces), indentation, tables and link references survive into the
# release verbatim. The heading is dropped because the GitHub release already
# carries the version in its own title.
#
# WHAT IT ACCEPTS is Keep a Changelog, the shape CHANGELOG.md uses, read
# liberally around the version and strictly on the version itself:
#
#     ## [0.11.0] - 2026-10-01     the shape a release section takes
#     ## [v0.11.0] — 2026-10-01    a `v`, an em dash
#     ## 0.11.0                    no brackets, no date
#
# Level two only: `###` is the subsection level *inside* a section (`### Added`),
# so accepting it as a version heading would make "where does this section end"
# ambiguous. A section ends at the next `#` or `##` heading, or at end of file —
# except inside a fenced code block, where a `# comment` line is code and not a
# heading.
#
# A RETROSPECTIVE HEADING IS NOT EXTRACTABLE, by construction. CHANGELOG.md
# summarizes the releases before it adopted this gate one minor line at a time,
# under `## 0.9.x`. `0.9.x` is not a version anyone can release, and `0.9.0`
# does not match it, because the version has to be followed by `]`, whitespace
# or the end of the line. A bare `## 0.9` would be unsafe for the same reason
# `0.9.0` is safe, and test-changelog-section.sh checks every retrospective
# heading in the real file.
#
# RELATIVE LINKS, AND WHY THE RELEASE BODY NEEDS THEM ABSOLUTE. The file links
# the repository's own docs the repository's way — `[wire bridge](docs/reference/wire-bridge.md)`
# — because that is what a link checker can follow, so a dead link or a dead
# anchor is caught before it can ship. But a GitHub release body is not rendered
# inside the repository tree: GitHub leaves the href exactly as written, and the
# page it sits on is `/releases/tag/v0.11.0`, so every such link resolves under
# `/releases/tag/` and 404s. Since a tag is never moved, that is a dead link that
# can never be fixed. `--link-base` is how CI closes the gap: given
# `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<tag>/`, every relative link target is
# printed prefixed with it — pinned to the tag, so it shows the doc as it stood
# for that release — and a bare `#anchor` is pointed at `CHANGELOG.md#anchor`.
# Without the option the body is byte-for-byte as written. Absolute URLs,
# `mailto:` and the like are left alone, as is anything inside a code span or a
# fenced block, where `](x)` is text and not a link.
#
# HARD-WRAPPED PROSE, AND WHY THE RELEASE BODY NEEDS IT JOINED. The file is
# wrapped at about 100 columns so it diffs and reviews well. GitHub renders a
# release body the way it renders a comment, with every newline a `<br>` (Vantage
# measured this on its v0.7.0 release page), so the wrapping would arrive as a
# ragged column. `--unwrap` joins each paragraph and each list item back onto one
# line and leaves everything whose line breaks mean something: fences, tables,
# headings, HTML, reference definitions, block quotes, indented code, and a hard
# break written as two trailing spaces or a backslash.
#
# The version has to match whole. `0.11.0` will not find `## [0.11.0-rc1]` or
# `## [10.11.0]`: the requested version must be followed by `]`, whitespace, or
# the end of the line, and `-` is none of those.
